# 🧮 Age Calculator (Python Tkinter)

This is a simple **GUI-based Age Calculator** built using Python's `tkinter` module. It calculates the age difference between a date of birth and a given date, displaying the result in years, months, and days.

## 📌 Features

- GUI built with `tkinter`
- Takes input for birth date and a comparison date
- Calculates and displays age in years, months, and days
- Input validation with error messages
- Clear button to reset all fields


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** – for building the graphical user interface
- **messagebox** – for error handling

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Washia439/Age-calculator.git
   cd Age-calculator
Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python age_calculator.py
(Make sure the file is named appropriately — change to match your file name if needed.)

🎯 How It Works
Users enter two dates:

Date of Birth

Given Date (reference date to calculate age)

Click the "Resultant Age" button to display:

Years, Months, Days between the two dates

"Clear All" button resets all fields

⚠️ Notes
Ensure all fields are filled in before calculation.

Dates should be valid (e.g., 31 Feb is invalid).
